# Welcome to Habit Builder!

### Habit Builder is an app I built to help people keep track of their weekly habit goals to stay motivated, build consistency and keep track of everything they need to do. It uses Core Data and Cloud Kit to persist data while utilising the User Notifications framework to push reminders to the user.
