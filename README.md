# Welcome to Habit Builder!

Habit Builder is an app I built to help people keep track of their weekly habit goals to stay motivated, build consistency and keep track of everything they need to do. It uses Core Data and Cloud Kit to persist data while utilising the User Notifications framework to push reminders to the user.

### What I learned

Habit Builder is one of the first projects I ever made in learning to become an app developer. Its safe to say I've actually rebuilt this from scatch about 5 or 6 times. Funnily enough I never intended for this to be a major app, it was more just a simple app to teach myself the foundations of Swift. I soon realised that an app like this would be personally very handy for me and decided I wanted to make something I would personally use everyday. 

I initially started with a story board build. I had barely made anything outside of tutorials and it was very slow going. Over time I was able to increase the complexity, improve the UI & UX, add more and more features and add more complex calculations. 

In my final rebuild of the app I did away with story boards, moved entirely to programmatic code, added core data, cloud kit, User Notifications and many other features to finally have an app I felt confident shipping to the app store. 

### Accomplishments
- App store submission accepted in first attempt
- 5 star app store rating
- Successfully migrated from storyboard to programmatic
- Custom built annual bar chart
- App Built completely independently
